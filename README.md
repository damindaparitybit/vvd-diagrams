# VMware Validated Design 6.0.1

With each release of the VMware Validated Designs, the Solutions Architecture and Information Experience teams create or update the diagrams provided in the Architecture and Design sections of the documentation. These are created as vector files with which we export the `.PNG` files you see in the official documentation.

It's our pleasure to share the diagrams from VMware Validated Design 6.0.1 release in Microsoft Visio format with the community. 

If you have deployed or plan to deploy the VMware Validated Design, you can use these diagrams to update hostnames, IP addresses, and the like for your environment.

The set includes:

* Standard Architecture (Single Region and Multi-AZ).
    * Management Domain
    * Workload Domain - Virtual Infrastructure
    * Workload Domain - vSphere with Tanzu
    * Cloud Operations and Automation
    * Backup and Restore

> NOTE: All official diagrams for the VMware Validated Design are provided in the product documentation found at vmware.com/go/vvd-docs.
